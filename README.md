# HarryPotterInvisibleCloakUsing-OpenCV
* In this python project, we developed invisible cloak  which you will become invisible using OpenCV framework

## About Invisible Cloak Project
* We will create the invisible cloak using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. In order to make this project, you’ll need a single-color cloth. * The cloth should not contain any other color visible. Here we are using a green cloth to develop this python project.

## Why single-color cloth?

- Because we are using color detection and segmentation techniques. If any other color is visible in our cloak then we have to process the image frame for that color also.

### Note:
* Cloth color should be unique relative to the background. (i.e. If the cloth is green then the background shouldn’t contain any green color)
* In good lighting conditions, it works best.
* Try to choose red, green or blue cloth, because these three colors are easier to detect.
## Color Detection & Segmentation
- So what is Color Detection and Segmentation in Image Processing?
- Color detection is a technique where we can detect any color in a given range of HSV color space.
- Image segmentation is the process of labeling every pixel in an image, where each pixel having the same label shares certain characteristics.


## Steps to Build Invisible Cloak OpenCV Project:
<p>Now we have everything ready. Below are the steps to create invisible cloak:</p>

1. Import necessary packages and Initialize the camera.
2. Store a single frame before starting the infinite loop.
3. Detect the color of the cloth and create a mask.
4. Apply the mask on frames.
5. Combine masked frames together.
6. Removing unnecessary noise from masks.


### Why HSV?
- HSV stands for HUE, SATURATION, and VALUE (or brightness). It is a cylindrical color space.
- HUE: The hues are modeled as an angular dimension which encodes color information.
- SATURATION: Saturation encodes intensity of color.
- VALUE: Value represents the brightness of the color.

* Here we can see in the frame wherever the green color is detected the mask shows that as white. The rest of the region is black

## Used Technologies in this project:
- Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.7.10 in this project)
- Numpy – 1.19.2
- OpenCV – 4.5
* To install opencv, run the below command. Numpy will be automatically installed.
* `pip install opencv-python`

## Summary:
In this machine learning project, we have created Invisible Cloak using OpenCV. We implemented color detection and segmentation technique. In this opencv project, we learned about morphological operations, masking, and other image processing concepts.
